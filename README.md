#Trippin Dots
[Trippin' Dots](http://trippindots.herokuapp.com)

We're visualizing songs with dots using the Echo Nest and iTunes APIs. The concept was to create dots the represent the intensity of a note or sound and break the representation into to segments based on the Echonest analysis. The user can search for a song and it will pull the data load it and represent it dynamically.

Tripping dots was created during an 8 hour hackathon at the Etsy Month Music Hackathon
